# SPDX BLASTER!

ðŸš§ This project is under construction! ðŸš§ 

Write [SPDX license IDs](https://spdx.dev/ids/) into your source files. 

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Terkwood/spdx-blaster
cd spdx-blaster
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

For now, the tool can only deal with individual files (and not very many types of them).

```sh
spdx-blaster qux.rs
```

Having run the utility, you'll see a comment prepended at the top of the file:

```text
$ cat qux.rs
